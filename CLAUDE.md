# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is the **EmberCare Business Strategy & Commercialization** repository - a business planning and strategy execution repository for the EmberCare medication management application. This repository focuses on business strategy, market research, and commercialization efforts rather than technical code.

**Key Context:**
- **Project:** EmberCare - Desktop medication management application for family caregivers
- **Status:** Technical foundation 90% complete (200+ dev hours invested in separate technical repo)
- **Timeline:** 2025-2028 (3-year plan with exit strategy options)
- **Current Phase:** Stage 1 - Market Validation Phase

## Repository Structure & Purpose

### Business Strategy Documents
- `/strategy/` - Strategic planning documents including unified strategy with decision gates framework
- `/sales/` - Asset sale strategy and buyer analysis for potential exit paths
- `project-management-guide.md` - GitLab Issues-based project management system

### Content Areas
- **Strategic Planning:** Staged execution model with validation gates
- **Market Research:** Buyer personas and competitive analysis  
- **Asset Valuation:** Current state assessment and monetization options
- **Project Management:** Issue-driven execution tracking

## Business Context & Decision Framework

### Strategic Approach
**Core Philosophy:** "Validate → Scale → Systematize"
- Stage 1 (Months 1-6): Market validation with minimal complexity
- Stage 2 (Months 7-18): Growth model selection based on proven results
- Stage 3 (Years 2-5): Optional platform development for portfolio approach

### Critical Decision Gates
1. **Decision Gate 1 (Month 6):** Continue vs. Exit evaluation
   - Continue if: $2K+ MRR, manageable CAC, positive market feedback
   - Exit if: Slow growth, high acquisition costs, attractive sale offers

2. **Decision Gate 2 (Month 18):** Single app vs. Portfolio strategy
   - Portfolio if: $5K+ MRR, proven customer acquisition, market validation
   - Single app if: Growth plateauing, acquisition challenges, focus preference

### Financial Targets
- **Conservative Path:** $400K over 3 years
- **Aggressive Path:** $1M+ over 5 years (activated at Decision Gate 2)

## Project Management System

### GitLab Issues Workflow
This repository uses GitLab Issues as the primary project management system:

**Issue Types:**
- `milestone` - Strategic milestones and decision gates
- `strategy` - Strategic planning and analysis
- `development` - Technical development tasks
- `sales` - Buyer outreach and sales activities
- `market-research` - Competitive analysis and market intelligence
- `weekly-sprint` - Weekly execution plans and progress tracking

**Priority Levels:**
- `urgent` - Next 1-7 days
- `high-priority` - Next 2-4 weeks  
- `low-priority` - Future planning

### Tracking & Reviews
- **Daily:** Update progress in active sprint issue comments
- **Weekly:** Complete sprint reviews, create next week's issues
- **Monthly:** Strategic milestone assessment and decision gate preparation

## Key Documents to Reference

### Primary Strategy Documents
- `strategy/unified-strategy.md` - Master strategic framework with decision gates
- `sales/asset-sale-strategy.md` - Exit strategies and buyer analysis
- `project-management-guide.md` - Execution methodology using GitHub Issues

### Key Metrics to Track
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) progression
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)  
- Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)
- Development velocity and time investment
- Market response and validation indicators

## Working with This Repository

### For Business Strategy Tasks
1. Review current strategic documents in `/strategy/` folder
2. Check active GitLab issues for current priorities
3. Update progress in issue comments using provided templates
4. Reference decision gate criteria for strategic evaluation

### For Market Research Tasks
1. Use buyer persona frameworks in `/sales/` documents
2. Track research progress in relevant GitLab issues
3. Document findings in issue comments for strategic review
4. Update buyer databases and competitive analysis

### For Asset Sale Analysis
1. Reference current valuation models in `/sales/asset-sale-strategy.md`
2. Track buyer outreach progress in GitLab issues
3. Document market feedback for decision gate analysis
4. Update pricing strategy based on market response

## Current Immediate Priorities

**Week 1 Focus (September 11, 2025):**
1. Desktop UI completion for EmberCare (technical work in separate repo)
2. Buyer research and prospect database building
3. Market validation preparation
4. Decision Gate 1 framework preparation

**Success Definition:**
This project management approach succeeds when daily tasks clearly connect to business objectives, decision gates are supported by tracked metrics, and progress toward strategic milestones is visible and measurable.

## Notes for Claude Code

- This is a **business strategy repository**, not a technical codebase
- Focus on strategic analysis, market research, and business planning tasks
- Use GitLab Issues system extensively for project management
- All work should ladder up to decision gate preparation and strategic milestone achievement
- Document progress and insights in issue comments for strategic review
- Reference the staged execution model when evaluating priorities and trade-offs
